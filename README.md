# Ordering App

## Technologies used: React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase.

The e-food ordering app is a web application that allows users to browse and order food from their favorite restaurants online. 
It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, as the frontend framework. 
The backend is built using Express.js, a Node.js framework for building web applications, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store the data. 
Firebase, a platform for developing mobile and web applications, is used for user authentication and login.

The app's interface allows users to view a list of available restaurants, browse their menus, and place orders for delivery or pickup. 
Users can also view their previous orders and track their current orders in real-time. 
The app also allows users to create an account and save their personal information and preferred delivery addresses for a faster checkout experience.

The app's backend is responsible for handling all the data-related operations, such as fetching and updating information from the MongoDB database.
The backend communicates with the frontend through an API, which allows for seamless integration between the two.

Overall, the e-food ordering app provides a convenient and user-friendly way for customers to order food online.
